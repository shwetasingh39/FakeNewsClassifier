# FakeNewsClassifier
Is it fake or factual? 🕵️‍♂️ Fake News Classifier using Naive Bayes on Kaggle dataset. Implements text vectorization, feature engineering, and model tuning with GridSearchCV to accurately detect misinformation.

## 🔍 Problem Statement

With the rise of misinformation online, identifying fake news automatically has become a critical challenge. This project utilizes the [Kaggle Fake News dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/clmentbisaillon/fake-and-real-news-dataset) to build an intelligent text classification system.
